# Knight's Tour Problem Solver

This Ruby code solves the Knight's Tour problem, which is finding the shortest path for a knight piece to move on a chessboard and visit every square exactly once. The code defines a MoveNode class that represents the position of the knight on the board and keeps track of its parent and children. It also provides a `breadth-first search` algorithm. The display_parent method is used to display the path. The code outputs the shortest path for the knight to move from the starting position of `[1,1]` to the ending position of `[8,8]`.
